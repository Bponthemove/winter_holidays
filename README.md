This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

A landing page of one of my favorite brands. Created because of practising with Next.js, scrolling behaviour and image processing
Links are not working as it is to practise the landing page.

Used Next, Sas, and Typescript.
Still have to fix the helmet scrolling in mobile.
